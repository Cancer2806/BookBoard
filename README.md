## Description

A fabulous place for sharing (and selling) original content.  The responsive application allows creators of original works to upload their work (books, zines, comics, etc.) to a central marketplace, for reading by other users (consumers) of the application.  Users can view their profile, which will show books they've uploaded, and other pertinent information.  Consumers are able to search the marketplace by various criteria, in order to identify items of interest to them.  Consumers can then view the item, or download.  Consumers are able to leave reviews of the items they have read through which the creators can learn and improve their offerings.
